# Welcome
{: .fs-9 }
The Zero G documentation will give you a start building your project, learning all about 3D printing and more!
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

## Getting started
On this website you'll find all sorts of information, [ABS Printing Tips](/manual/print/abs), [Print Settings](/standard/print/settings), [Design Guidelines](/standard/cad/guidelines), [Mainsail Theme](/klipper/mainsail/theme), [Manuals](/manual/build) and more!

Currently we're working on instructions for two of our projects. Our projects are **Mercury One.1** and **Hydra**.

*The documentation is still a work in progress so keep in mind it's not complete.*

[Mercury One.1](/manual/build/mercury_eva){: .btn .btn-red } [Hydra](/manual/build/hydra){: .btn }
