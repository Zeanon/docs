# Build Instructions
{: .no_toc }

It's time to roll up our sleeves and get building with the release of our long-awaited PDF build instructions for the Mercury One.1.

We owe a huge debt of gratitude to our incredible community member, <i class="bi bi-discord"> **jonspaceharper**, for their dedication in bringing these instructions to life.

But we couldn't have done it without you, our community! Your continuous feedback and support have been instrumental in refining both the build instructions and the project itself.
