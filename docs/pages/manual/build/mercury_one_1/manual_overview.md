# MERCURY ONE.1
{: .no_toc }


## WHAT’S THIS PROJECT ABOUT?
{: .no_toc }

The Mercury One.1 upgrade transforms your current Ender 5(Pro/Plus) into a CoreXY system. This provides an improvement over the Cartesian system, which relies on V-rollers that may lack precision and demand considerable maintenance. Additionally, the CoreXY system is optimized for higher speeds, enhancing your 3D printing experience and quality.

## WHO’S THIS PROJECT FOR?
{: .no_toc }

If you're an Ender 5, Ender 5 Pro, or Ender 5 Plus owner who is dissatisfied with print quality, speed, or encountering other issues, consider this upgrade. Whether you're interested in learning how to modify printers or simply seeking an enjoyable new project, this is the perfect opportunity for you!

## WHAT MACHINES DOES THIS RUN ON?
{: .no_toc }

We support the Ender 5, Ender 5 Pro, and Ender 5 Plus frames when upgrading to Mercury One.1. To install this upgrade, you will need to remove the X and Y motion system from the existing frame.<br/>**<span class="zero-g-red">Please note</span> that some <span class="zero-g-red">soldering or wire extension may be necessary</span>** during this process.

## DIFFICULTY
{: .no_toc }

We consider this build to be easy to moderate in difficulty. However, the more challenging aspects might be the firmware and wiring. As of now, we haven't written any configuration for Klipper, and some wires may need to be remade or extended.
